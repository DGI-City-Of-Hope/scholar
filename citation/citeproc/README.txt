This module is meant to fully encapsulate the functionality of the citeproc-js library but for use within Drupal. At the
moment it does not fully support citeproc-js.

Notes:

The styles repository is currently housed at zotero.org. Note that styles in the Zotero styles repository are currently
at CSL version 0.8.1. Use the tools provided by the CSL project to convert CSL 0.8.1 styles to the version 1.0
syntax supported by this processor.

The citeproc-php library has been modified, do not just replace with the latest version.

class_rtf.php comes from the biblio drupal project, and has been modified for use here.
